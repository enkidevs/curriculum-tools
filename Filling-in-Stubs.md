# How to fill-in a stub

First of all, take a look at the [[List of Stubs]]. There, you'll find a list of eligible stubs to add to. Pick one you want to deepen your knowledge by writing about. Next, look at the questions in the insight. These are the questions we've chosen as a community to test that particular insight. You'll need to explain the general topic in enough detail that the user will be able to answer the question, but will need to consider it carefully. 

In order to add your explanation to the insight, fork the repository, add your explanation, and file a pull request to the `master` branch. Add the `awaiting-review` tag to your pull request. A community mentor / reviewer will review your insight and make comments to improve the overall readability and clarity of your insight, and potentially challenge you to add details or explain in a more elegant way. Once it's approved by a mentor / reviewer, it will be added to the curriculum with a link to your github handle, crediting you with authorship of the article. Once all of the workouts in a section are fully filled out, your article will appear in our app, and in our other educational products.
