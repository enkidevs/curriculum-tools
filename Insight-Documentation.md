### What's an Insight?
An **Insight** is a short article covering a small, well-defined objective. It features metadata for analysis purposes, a practice opportunity, a question designed to test your memory, and a multiple-choice quiz-style question. If you're going to fill in an insight, check out the [[Filling in Stubs]] article for the process.


# Insight Metadata

An insight has some metadata that helps our systems organize and quantify the curriculum. It also helps us understand how well a user understands a given concept. Any metadata is supported, but there are a few that are required.

## Location-based Metadata

#### **Topic**

The **topic** usually refers to the language or framework an insight exists within. **Users** _subscribe_ to **Topics**.

Take a look at our [[List of Topics]]

In this GitHub repository, every directory in the first hierarchy level represents a separate topic. To specify the **topic** of an insight simply ensure the insightâ€™s file is placed within the right **topic** directory.

#### **Course**

A **course** represents a more specific area of content. Every **course** folder is contained in a **topic** folder. Each topic in the [[List of Topics]] should have it's subtopics listed.

## Insight Content

## Article


Articles should be short and SEXI. 

Short means that they should cover the smallest possible topic in a non-exhaustive way. Typically less than 500 words, with an image or code example. Brevity is key, because these aren't meant to be a wall of text. **An Article is meant to cover only enough for the user to correctly answer the questions attached**.

SEXI is an acroynm for how explainations should be structured.
- **S** State: State or define the concept. "Functions are a way to encapsulate and reuse code."
- **E** Elaborate: Explain in more detail or qualify the concept. "Functions take an input and produce an output, and  can be composed together to control the flow of a program."
- **X** Exemplify: Give an example of when you might use this, establish context. "Functions are useful when you need to perform a repeated action and you want to give that action a name." You can also visualize the abstract form here: `function ([arg1, arg2, args...]) {[function body]}`
- **I** Illustrate: Show an example that is not abstract. `function add(a,b) { return a + b }`
