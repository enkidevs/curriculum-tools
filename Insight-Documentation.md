### What's an Insight?
An **Insight** is a short article covering a small, well-defined objective. It features metadata for analysis purposes, a practice opportunity, a question designed to test your memory, and a multiple-choice quiz-style question.


## Insight Metadata

An insight has some metadata that helps our systems organize and quantify the curriculum. It also helps us understand how well a user understands a given concept. Any metadata is supported, but there are a few that are required.





## Insight Content

## Article


Articles should be short and SEXI. 

Short means that they should cover the smallest possible topic in a non-exhaustive way. Typically less than 500 words, with an image or code example. Brevity is key, because these aren't meant to be a wall of text. **An Article is meant to cover only enough for the user to correctly answer the questions attached**.

SEXI is an acroynm for how explainations should be structured.
- **S** State: State or define the concept. "Functions are a way to encapsulate and reuse code."
- **E** Elaborate: Explain in more detail or qualify the concept. "Functions take an input and produce an output, and  can be composed together to control the flow of a program."
- **X** Exemplify: Give an example of when you might use this, establish context. "Functions are useful when you need to perform a repeated action and you want to give that action a name." You can also visualize the abstract form here: `function ([arg1, arg2, args...]) {[function body]}`
- **I** Illustrate: Show an example that is not abstract. `function add(a,b) { return a + b }`
