Welcome to the content wiki!

Read our [[Getting Started Guide]] if this is your first time contributing.
We have adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html) as our code of conduct. The easiest way to abide by it is to remember that **this is a learning community, and we are here to help each other out**. 

If you'd like to get started helping out, view the [[List of Stubs]]. Stubs are insights that have questions, but no accompanying text. If you'd like to challenge your understanding of a subject by writing a *short* article about it, this is a great place to start. Keep in mind that your article should help the reader understand how to answer the accompanying questions or tasks.

If you'd like to pioneer content development (eg, write about new stuff that isn't in the list of stubs), you can check out the [[Proposed Topics]] section to propose a topic. If you want to add a subtopic under an existing topic, check out that section's proposed subtopics list. There's a [[List of Topics]] here, with planning and discussion boards, instructional design resources, and links to work in progress. Join the Contributor's Slack by sending an email to content@enki.com.

Read the [[Creating a Course Guide]] and the [[Writing Standards and Assessments]] guide when you're thinking about writing a course on this platform, and get in contact with the head of content, liz at enki and the tld is com.
