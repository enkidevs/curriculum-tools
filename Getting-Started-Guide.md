# Getting Started

Hello! Welcome to Enki's open-source developer learning materials. These materials power the Enki ecosystem, and are the combined efforts of many developers worldwide. You can use these materials to teach or train developers, or you can use our system to view them as a curriculum.

## How the Curriculum is Organized

The curriculum is organized under Topics, which are the top-level folder in the repository. Under each of these Topics, you can find Subtopics or Courses (same thing). Each Course has [Standards](https://github.com/sagelabs/standards) (defined in a separate repository), and Workouts. Under each workout is some number of Insights and Games, usually around 5 of them.

Standards are the skills you learn in each course or subtopic. [[Workouts|Workout Documentation]] are the individual batches of curriculum you do in a day.

## Writing open-source content

You can also help extend and write the curriculum! There are a few ways to contribute:

### Add a Workout: [[Workout Documentation]]
### Add an Insight: [[Insight Documentation]]
### Write what you know: [[Filling in Stubs]]
### Plan a course: [[Planning a Course]]
### Add a tip: [[Tips and Tricks]]
