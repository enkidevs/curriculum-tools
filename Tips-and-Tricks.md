Tips and Tricks are unstructured content in our ecosystem that doesn't exactly "fit", either because it's part of a lesson that isn't complete, or is something not really covered by our standards. 
The best place for these tips is in a Topic and Subtopic, outside of any workout. Consider the tags carefully when you write a tip- Obscura is most common Aspect for tips, followed by Workout or Deep. 

Consider whether or not you're creating an entire lesson- more than one insight, and it's likely you're trying to create a lesson. If so, read the [[Creating a Course Guide]].
